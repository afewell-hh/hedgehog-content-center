## Development Guidelines

### Code Organization
- API routes in `/app/api/`
- React components in `/app/components/`
- Database schema in `/prisma/`
- Documentation in `/docs/`

### Best Practices
1. **Error Handling**
   - Use try-catch blocks for API calls
   - Provide detailed error messages
   - Implement proper validation
   - Log errors appropriately

2. **Security**
   - Store sensitive data in environment variables
   - Validate input data
   - Handle errors gracefully
   - Follow security best practices

3. **Documentation**
   - Keep TOI documents updated
   - Document API endpoints
   - Include code comments
   - Maintain README
