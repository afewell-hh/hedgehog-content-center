# KB Prompt Enhancement Project Plan

## Project Overview
This document outlines the plan for enhancing the KB entry generation system, focusing on improving prompt engineering and LLM response quality for the Quick Update feature.

## Goals & Success Criteria
1. **Primary Goals**
   - Improve ~230 existing glossary entries
   - Maintain consistent quality across diverse technical topics
   - Optimize for SEO while maintaining educational value
   - Integrate Hedgehog references naturally and meaningfully

2. **Success Metrics**
   - Content meets SEO best practices (300-1000 words)
   - Natural integration of technical keywords
   - High-quality, educational content for technical professionals
   - Meaningful Hedgehog references that add value

## Content Requirements

### 1. Subtitle Field
- **Purpose**: Concise but educational glossary definition
- **Length**: 1-2 sentences
- **Style**: 
  - Professional yet approachable
  - Technical accuracy without jargon overload
  - Consider existing subtitle for context/focus
- **Example**:
  ```
  Underlay or underlay network refers to the switches, ports, cables, NICs, servers and network protocols that provide the foundation for the Hedgehog Open Network Fabric
  ```

### 2. Body Field
- **Purpose**: 
  - Demonstrate Hedgehog's relevance
  - Provide additional educational context
- **Length**: Moderate (targeting SEO sweet spot)
- **Structure**:
  - Natural flow between concepts
  - Hedgehog references integrated contextually
  - Cross-linking opportunities noted
- **Example**:
  ```
  It consists of the underlying hardware, such as routers, switches, and physical connections, as well as the basic network protocols that manage data transmission across this hardware. The underlay network is essential for ensuring reliable, high-performance, and scalable connectivity for distributed cloud infrastructure.

  The Hedgehog underlay network includes choice of network switches from a variety of vendors including Celestica, Dell, Edgecore and Supermicro...
  ```

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Research & Analysis System
1. **Research Component**
   - Implement methodical web search across Hedgehog sources
   - Create knowledge graph of Hedgehog capabilities
   - Map relationships between technical concepts
   - Track cross-linking opportunities

2. **Analysis Component**
   - Evaluate existing content for context
   - Identify business value connections
   - Map technical concepts to Hedgehog benefits
   - Generate potential cross-linking suggestions

### Phase 2: Content Generation System
1. **Prompt Engineering**
   ```
   [Detailed prompt structure to be developed in separate doc]
   Key elements:
   - Context understanding
   - Research guidance
   - Style requirements
   - Business value focus
   - SEO optimization
   ```

2. **Quality Control System**
   - Implement rubric-based self-evaluation
   - Create judge system for quality validation
   - Track cross-linking opportunities
   - Verify SEO optimization

### Phase 3: Testing & Refinement
1. **Initial Testing**
   - Test with diverse entry types
   - Validate against examples
   - Measure SEO metrics
   - Review Hedgehog reference quality

2. **Refinement Process**
   - Collect examples for in-context learning
   - Consider dspy or similar for automated tuning
   - Develop comprehensive test suite
   - Create feedback loop for improvements

## Technical Implementation Notes
