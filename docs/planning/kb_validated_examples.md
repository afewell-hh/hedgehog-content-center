### Validated Version
**Title:** back-end network

**Subtitle:**
A dedicated network segment designed to support the extreme performance demands of AI training and inference workloads. To handle the intensive GPU-to-GPU communication requirements, these networks implement specialized protocols like RoCEv2, RDMA, PFC, and ECN.

**Body:**
Back-end networks form the critical data fabric that enables distributed AI training and inference at scale. These networks are engineered to handle the unique demands of AI workloads, particularly the intensive east-west traffic patterns generated during multi-GPU training operations. The network must maintain consistent high bandwidth and ultra-low latency to prevent AI training slowdowns and ensure responsive inference.

Modern back-end networks leverage RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access) over Converged Ethernet version 2 (RoCEv2) to enable direct GPU-to-GPU communication over standard Ethernet infrastructure. This powerful combination, along with Priority Flow Control (PFC) to prevent packet loss and Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to maintain optimal throughput, creates a lossless fabric essential for AI workloads. The Hedgehog fabric implements these features in a cloud-native architecture that automatically optimizes network performance for AI workloads, ensuring training jobs complete faster and inference remains responsive.

Network architects typically design back-end networks with non-blocking topologies like spine-leaf to maximize bandwidth between any pair of nodes. This architectural approach, combined with intelligent traffic management and hardware acceleration, helps eliminate bottlenecks that could impact AI application performance. The result is a high-performance computational environment where distributed AI workloads can operate at their full potential.

## Example 2: passive node

### Original Version
**Title:** passive node

**Subtitle:**
A passive node is a standby node that is not actively participating in processing tasks or serving requests under normal operating conditions.

**Body:**
A passive node in a computing environment, particularly in the context of distributed systems or high availability configurations, refers to a standby node that is not actively participating in processing tasks or serving requests under normal operating conditions. Passive nodes typically exist as redundant components to provide failover capabilities and ensure system resilience in the event of failures or disruptions.<br><br>### Key Characteristics of a Passive Node:<br><br>1. **Standby State**: A passive node remains in a standby or idle state while not actively processing workloads or serving requests. It is ready to assume active responsibilities if needed but remains inactive under normal circumstances.<br><br>2. **Redundancy**: Passive nodes serve as redundant components to provide fault tolerance and high availability. They replicate the functionality of active nodes and are activated only when an active node fails or becomes unavailable.<br><br>3. **Synchronization**: Passive nodes often maintain synchronized copies of data or state with active nodes to ensure consistency and readiness for failover. Data replication mechanisms or synchronization protocols are used to keep passive nodes up-to-date with the latest changes.<br><br>4. **Automatic Failover**: In high availability configurations, passive nodes automatically take over the responsibilities of failed active nodes through a process known as failover. When an active node fails, a passive node transitions to an active state to maintain uninterrupted service.<br><br>5. **Monitoring and Heartbeats**: Passive nodes are continuously monitored by active nodes or external monitoring systems to detect failures or availability issues. Heartbeat mechanisms or health checks are used to ensure that passive nodes are responsive and ready to take over in case of failures.<br><br>6. **Resource Conservation**: Passive nodes conserve resources such as CPU, memory, and network bandwidth by remaining inactive until needed. This helps optimize resource utilization and reduce operational costs in environments with fluctuating workloads.<br><br>### Use Cases of Passive Nodes:<br><br>1. **High Availability Clusters**: Passive nodes are commonly used in high availability configurations to provide redundancy and failover capabilities. They serve as standby components that automatically take over the workload of failed active nodes to maintain continuous operation.<br><br>2. **Disaster Recovery**: In disaster recovery setups, passive nodes act as standby resources in geographically distributed locations to ensure business continuity in the event of catastrophic failures or natural disasters.<br><br>3. **Database Replication**: Passive nodes are often used in database replication setups to maintain synchronized copies of data for backup, disaster recovery, or read-only purposes. They replicate data from active nodes and can be promoted to active status in case of primary node failures.<br><br>4. **Load Balancing and Scaling**: Passive nodes can be used in load-balanced environments to handle increased traffic or workload spikes. They remain idle under normal conditions but can be activated to scale out the capacity of the system as needed.<br><br>5. **Software Updates and Maintenance**: Passive nodes can temporarily assume active roles during software updates, maintenance activities, or node reboots. This allows active nodes to be taken offline for maintenance without impacting service availability.<br><br>### Conclusion:<br><br>Passive nodes play a crucial role in ensuring the resilience, fault tolerance, and high availability of distributed systems and high availability configurations. By serving as standby components ready to take over in case of failures, passive nodes contribute to the reliability and continuity of critical services and applications in diverse use cases and environments.

### Validated Version
**Title:** passive node

**Subtitle:**
A passive node is a component within a distributed computing system designed to remain in standby mode without actively handling tasks or client requests, poised to take over in case the primary, or active, node fails. This concept is key to high availability and fault tolerance strategies, enabling uninterrupted service continuity.

**Body:**
Passive nodes are a traditional approach to high availability where standby components remain idle until needed for failover. While this concept originated in traditional networking with protocols like VRRP (Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol), where backup routers would remain passive until primary failure, modern cloud-native architectures have evolved toward more efficient approaches.

The Hedgehog fabric exemplifies this evolution through its cloud-native architecture. Instead of using passive nodes that leave resources idle, it leverages Kubernetes-style distributed systems patterns with leader election mechanisms for its controllers, while implementing active-active networking with ECMP (Equal-Cost Multi-Path) and MC-LAG (Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation) for maximum resource utilization. This approach ensures high availability without the bandwidth limitations inherent in active-passive configurations.

Understanding passive nodes remains important as they continue to serve specific use cases, particularly in database replication scenarios and disaster recovery sites. However, the trend in modern infrastructure design favors active-active architectures that distribute workloads across all available resources, improving both reliability and performance. This shift reflects broader changes in infrastructure design, where static, passive redundancy is giving way to dynamic, distributed resilience.
