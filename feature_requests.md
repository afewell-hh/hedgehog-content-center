Need to add some type of protection or version control to the prompt editing panels on the new and edit kb pages, it could be like version control with restore or some way to test prompts without saving and with the option to save or something.

Need to update the rfp_qa page to enable updating rfp_qa records. I may start this simply, but really need to update the data structures so that we maintain an original and immutable recordSet, and then have a version that is editable.
