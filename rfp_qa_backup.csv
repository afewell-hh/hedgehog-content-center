[Minimum (32 to 36) x100G, or 48x25G+4 x 100G)]","Hedgehog is quoting the Supermicro SSE-C4632SB with TD3x7 as a cost effective solution with 128k LPM routes and AC power.  However, this device does not meet UGF 1.9 or UGF 1.24 requirements.  

Dell Z9432 recommended for DC power and LPM routes
Hedgehog recommends the Dell Z9432 featuring the Broadcom Trident 4-X11 NPU as your standard leaf to meet 100% of the underlay requirements.  This model exceeds port requirements by a factor of 2 [DOWN/UP: 32x400G (400G, 100G, 40G, 25G, 10G)], but it is the only device that meets both UGF 1.9 and UGF 1.24 requirements. 
        UGF 1.9 requires all devices to support both AC and DC power.  The only device on the market supporting DC Power is the Dell Z9432 featuring a Trident 4-X11 NPU.
        UGF 1.24 requires a minimum unidimensional routing table supporting: 128K IPv6, 256K IPv4 LPM routes.  TD3-X7 devices are limited to 128k IPv6 or 128 IPv4 LPM routes.  Trident 4-X9 and Trident 4-X11 devices support 1M IPv6 or 1M IPv4 routes per system.  


AC alternatives with Trident X4
If DC power is not a hard requirement, Hedgehog also supports the Dell S5448 or Edgecore DCS240 meeting UGF 1.24 requirements at lower price points.    
        Dell S5448 -TD4x9 DOWN: 32x100G (100G, 50G, 40G, 25G, 10G) + UP: 8x400G (400G, 200G, 100G, 50G, 40G, 25G, 10G)

If installing software into the operating system, Describe how the solution works if an untrusted application owns the Operating System vs how it works if a T-Mobile infrastructure team owns it.","Hedgehog Open Network Fabric is a turnkey end-to-end private data center networking solution.
 
Hedgehog Open Network Fabric is designed to look and feel like a public cloud, providing a hyper-scale operational experience for DevOps and infrastructure ops teams. It enables them to effortlessly request, deploy, and run network resource operations and drive efficiency using standard GitOps and CI/CD processes, tools, and de facto cloud-native operational and observability stacks.

The central cloud concept of the Hedgehog Open Network Fabric solution is the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) abstraction, which hides network configuration complexity with simple tenant isolation.  Services such as inter-VPC peering, cloud gateway, internet gateway, site gateway, NAT/PAT, load balancing, firewall, and intrusion prevention are all built in. They Gateay is designed to be deployed with third-party services like firewalls or web-application firewalls. 

Hedgehog consists of three major parts:
1.  The Fabric: an open solution for the management and control of SONiC switches 
2.  The Service Gateway: an open software data plane that provides tenant gateway functionality
3.  The Controller: the software that controls the fabric and the gateway via unified VPC and Transit Gateway abstractions familiar to any AWS user.  It also includes a Zero Touch Provisioning [ ZTP] and a mechanism for automated software updates.

The Fabric and the Gateway dont have hard dependencies on each other and can be used separately. 

Hedgehog solution is distributed as an easy-to-consume software appliance. The package consists of:
1. SONiC open network OS
2. Hedgehog VPC service
3. Controller software, including Kubernetes
4. Data plane/Gateway software with ZTP
5. Hedgehog control plane agent software

The Hedgehog control plane is built on Kubernetes, which is self-managed and is only used for the Fabric.  Operating Hedgehog Fabric requires no prior Kubernetes expertise.  Logically, Hedgehog software turns the network under control into a Kubernetes cluster.

The controller with ZTP is installed on a lightweight server that is connected to the switches (either directly or through a management network, depending on the size of the environment). Hedgehog ZTP installs the SONiC open-source network operating system on data center switches and automatically inserts the control plane agent with base underlay configuration. In addition, Hedgehog ZTP service brings up and provisions Service Gateway nodes. The process requires defining a wiring diagram before booting. The wiring diagram is a YAML document that describes how network ports are cabled.

DevOps teams then use the controller API to provision tenants with isolated Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) that look, feel, and behave like VPC services available from AWS, Azure or GCP.  VPCs in a Hedgehog cloud network often need to peer with VPCs in other Hedgehog cloud locations or VPCs on AWS, Azure or GCP.  

The Hedgehog Service Gateway is a data plane that routes packets amongst VPCs with load balancing and security policies.  The data plane starts on SmartNICs in the host servers and extends through gateway servers that function as edge routers.  DevOps teams use the control plane API to configure transit, load balancing and security policies in the data plane.   Hedgehog tests, certifies, and supports Open Network Fabric on switches from various hardware partners.  

The Hedgehog data plane is currently designed for NVIDIA ConnectX-7 smartNICs installed in hosts and the gateway server.   Hedgehog will support NVIDIA Bluefield and AMD Pensando smartNICS in the future.","{""category"": ""OVERLAY GENERAL FUNCTION"", ""req_index"": ""OGF 1.1"", ""compliance"": ""Comply"", ""reference_document"": ""https://hubs.ly/Q02ZCqCg0""}",2025-01-09 07:41:41.132326-08,T-Mobile,ACME-1234,2025-01-01 00:00:00-08,TM-RFP-R-001
